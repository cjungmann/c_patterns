# C/C++ Patterns

I'm tired of repeatedly searching for obscure patterns to
remind myself how to accomplish some programming goal.  This
project will be a dumping ground for code that works for
a variety of situations.

Each pattern will include a README file and a code file
that can be compiled to perform some tests.

Rather than including a Makefile, each source file will
include a compile string in an EMACS *file local variables*
line.  In EMACS, compile with `M-x compile`.

- [Initializing Struct Arrays](README_init_struct_array.md)  
  I often iterate over static arrays to perform repetitve
  tasks like listing program options, simulate user responses,
  etc.  I frequently have trouble initializing these arrays.
  This guide should help me remember effective coding
  techniques.
